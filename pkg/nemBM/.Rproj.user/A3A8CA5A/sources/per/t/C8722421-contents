Description: To study network evolution models and different blockmodeling approaches. Various functions enable generating (temporal) networks with a selected blockmodel type, taking into account selected local network mechanisms. The development of this package is financially supported by the Slovenian Research Agency (www.arrs.gov.si) within the research programs P5-0168 and the research project J7-8279 (Blockmodeling multilevel and temporal networks).
