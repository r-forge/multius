Description: To study network evolution models and different blockmodeling approaches. Various functions enable generating (temporal) networks with a selected blockmodel type, taking into account selected local network mechanisms. The development of this package is financially supported the Slovenian Research Agency (www.arrs.gov.si) within the research program P5ñ0168 and the research project J5-2557 (Comparison and evaluation of different approaches to blockmodeling dynamic networks by simulations with application to Slovenian co-authorship networks).
